# Three-Layer-Password-Authentication
In this fast developing technological world, information sharing has become so common and hence information security has gained a lot of importance in the recent days. The most common way of information security is done through password protection. One or two levels of password protection can be broken through up to a limit. Hence, this project involves a three level password protection system. It contains three logins. The first level involves a simple text password login. The next level involves a graphical password combination of RGB buttons. The last level involves image based password where in the user will upload a picture, segment it and give a sequence for those segments. So this three level password authentication system is aimed to accomplish higher safety and reliability in authenticating users.
